# Generic View API
# Djangoâ€™s generic views, were developed as a shortcut for common usage patterns.
# These views allow us to build conventional APIs (common views) quickly without repeating ourselves.
# Promoting "DRY principle" by abstracting certain common patterns & idioms in view (API) development with "Generic Views".
